# Web API Testing

API testing is a software testing practice that tests the APIs directly from their functionality, reliability, performance, to security. Part of integration testing, API testing effectively validates the logic of the build architecture within a short amount of time.

This repository will give you an idea of how we can create our own framework for testing Web APIs using `Apache` `HTTP` library.

## Types of Web APIs:
* Open APIs
* Partner APIs
* Internal APIs
* Composite APIs

## API architecture
An APIâ€™s architecture consists of the rules that guide what information an API can share with clients and how it shares the data.
* REST API
* SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) API
* RPC(Remote Procedural Call) API

## HTTP Methods
- GET
- POST
- DELETE
- OPTION (204)
- PUT
- PATCH
- TRACE
- HEAD

## HTTP Headers
```
Request URL: https://api.github.com/
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 304 
Remote Address: 13.234.168.60:443
Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

```
## Basic Framework Structure
```
HttpGet get = new HttpGet(url);
Response = client.execute(get);
Int code = response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode();

```



## Roadmap

- Testing tools for Web APIs (I have used *github API)
- Importing the Dependencies required 
- Writing automation test scripts in java 
    - Test definition(Using BDD)
    ```
    - Given: API url is http://api.github.com
      When: User sends a GET request
      Then: Response status code is 200

    - Given: API url is http://api.github.com/nonexistingendpoint
      When: User sends a GET request
      Then: The response status code is 404

    ```
